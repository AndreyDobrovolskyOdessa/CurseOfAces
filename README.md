# CurseOfAces


## General description

CurseOfAces is a card game.

The deck used for this game consists of 36 cards - 6 to 10, J, Q, K and A in four suits.

Number of players may be 2, 3, 4.


## Gameplay

All players start the game with 6 cards each one.

Players make their moves in the clockwise order.

Player attacks the clockwise neighbour with some of available cards sequentially. 
An attacked player must beat all the cards played by an attacker - see "Defence rules". 
An attacker may start the move with any available card, 
but only the cards of values already present on the table during the current 
move may be used to continue an attack.

If an attacked player withstand an attack, then all the cards played during the current 
move leave the game field and an attacked player makes the next move. 
If attacked player is not able to beat all the cards played by an attacker, then he/she 
gathers all the cards played during the current move and loose the move.

After the move players refill their card sets up to 6 cards, in case 
the deck consists of sufficient number of cards. If the number of cards in the appears 
not to be sufficient, players refill their cards sets presumably to achieve equal 
number of cards. If it is not possible, the player to be attacked next recieve 
an extra card.

The game ends when all but one players use all their cards, and player who 
remains with some cards unplayed is the looser.


## Defence rules

Suits don't matter, only cards values are taken into consideration.

One card can beat the card with lower value. Examples

with the value, greater by 1. Examples

- Q and 7 beat Q or K but not A
- 6 and 6 beat 6 or 7 but not 8
- J and 9 beat J or Q but not K
