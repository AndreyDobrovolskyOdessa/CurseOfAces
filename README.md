# CurseOfAces

## General description

CurseOfAces is card game

Deck used for the game include 36 cards - 6 to 10, J, Q, K and A in four suits.

Number of players may be 2, 3, 4.


## Gameplay

All players start game with 6 cards each.

Players make their moves in the clockwise order.

Player attacks his clockwise neighbour sequentially with some of his cards. 
Attacked must beat the cards played by attacker with his own cards. If 
attacked player is not able to beat all the cards played by attacker he 
collects all the cards played during the current attack episode and loose 
his move. If attacked player withstand an attack, cards played during an 
episode leave the game field and make the next move.

Attacker may start an attack with any of his cards, but he can continue attack 
only with the cards of values already present on the table during the current 
attack.

After the game episode players refill their card sets up to 6 cards, in case 
the deck consists of sufficient number of cards. If number of cards appear not 
to be sufficient, players refill their cards sets presumably to achieve equal 
number of cards. If it is not possible, the player to be attacked next recieve 
an extra card.

The game ends when all but one players use all their cards, and player who 
remains with some cards unplayed is the looser.
